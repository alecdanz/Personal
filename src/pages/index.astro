      Hi, I'm Alec. <br />I build design systems that help teams move quickly.

      <p>
        I design systems and experiences that quietly make things better.
      </p>
      <p>
        Right now, I manage Alley-oop, the design system behind 
        <a href="https://espnbet.com/" target="_blank">ESPN BET</a>,  
        <a href="https://thescore.com/" target="_blank">theScore</a>, 
        and Hollywood Casino at Penn Interactive.

      Previously, I was Lead Product Designer at 
      <a href="https://prenda.com/" target="_blank">Prenda</a>
       I built the <a
          href="https://github.com/prenda-school/design-system"
          >Prenda Design System</a
        >, created a <a href="https://microschools.prenda.com/">marketplace</a> for learners and teachers, and helped shape Prendaâ€™s brand story.   
      </p>
      <p>
        Earlier in my career, I helped grow
        <a
          href="https://www.legalshield.com/">LegalShield
          </a
        >'s design team from two to ten, led a redesign of their mobile experience, and contributed to a full brand refresh.

        This site is my place to share work, ideas, and the occasional experiment in design.
