        I grew up in North Texas interested in design, art, and performance from
        a young age. My undergraduate degree is in Theatrical Design and
        Production from Oklahoma City University in 2015.

        In my spare time, I like to keep busy. I might be 80 feet up climbing
        granite in the Wichita Mountains. Or - at home tinkering in the garage
        on woodworking projects, throwing clay on my pottery wheel, or learning
        how to fix something in my historic home. It could be a Dungeons and
        Dragons night, board games day, or an afternoon with a new video game. I
        might be traveling - flying out to Florida, driving to El Paso, down in
        Dallas, or spending the week in Nicaragua. But most nights you'll find
        me cooking up something delish for dinner.

        Now-and-days I live in Oklahoma City with my wife Tiffany, daughter
        Gwen, two dogs <a href="https://www.instagram.com/shibasoftheshire/"
